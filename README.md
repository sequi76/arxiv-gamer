## Applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation to the Arxiv to infer user preferences

- The idea is to apply unsupervised machine learning through a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to the arxiv papers.

- With this goal, we have compiled a LDA model using the titles and abstracts from hep-th 10k articles.  One can load the LDA and play the game of letting the LDA learn & guess your preferences for the papers.
